5) Reviews and reputation APIs (Google, Yelp, Trustpilot, and the reality)

This part is tricky because many platforms restrict access.

Google reviews (2 different worlds)

Places API (Place Details)

Can return place info like ratings and reviews (Place Details API; you request fields via FieldMask).

For JS Places library, there’s explicit review retrieval via the reviews field.

Business Profile APIs (My Business)

Meant for managing your owned/managed business profiles; includes listing and replying to reviews.

Key implication:

For carrier due diligence, you usually don’t control the carrier’s profile → Business Profile API may not be usable unless you have authorized access. Places API is generally the “public place info” path.

Yelp Fusion API

Yelp provides an API for business search/matching and accessing Yelp business data.

Trustpilot APIs

Trustpilot has official API documentation for its APIs (often used by businesses / partners).

How agents “find reviews” in practice (real workflow)

Your agent should do listing resolution first, then pull reviews:

Entity resolution / listing match

Business name + address + phone → resolve Google Place ID / Yelp business ID / Trustpilot domain profile.

Pull what’s available via official APIs

Google Places Details (reviews subset + rating)

Yelp Fusion business data

Trustpilot APIs where permitted

Fill gaps with search + extraction

SERP search for "<carrier name>" + "reviews" + city/state, site:bbb.org, site:reddit.com, etc.

Extract the pages via Firecrawl/Diffbot/Apify and classify complaints into a taxonomy.

Detect review fraud patterns

Time clustering, repeated phrasing, suspicious reviewer profiles, etc.

(Worth noting: review manipulation is a known issue on major platforms; your system should treat reviews as signals, not truth.)

6) DOT/FMCSA authority, safety, OOS, and carrier identity (the “must have”)
FMCSA QCMobile API (official)

FMCSA provides a developer API for real-time carrier queries including safety data.

The docs list endpoints like:

lookup by name / DOT / docket

carrier basics

cargo carried

operation classification

out-of-service

docket numbers

authority endpoints


SAFER web + third-party wrappers

SAFER is the public system for company safety data.

There are also third-party “SAFER wrappers” offering historical snapshots and convenience endpoints (example: SaferWebAPI).

Apify also has prebuilt scrapers for SAFER/FMCSA pages if you need to automate when API data is insufficient.

Agent usage pattern

FMCSA API = structured, reliable source-of-truth for identity/authority gating.

Wrappers/scrapers = fill gaps (historical snapshots, UI-only data) while respecting ToS and your risk posture.

7) Business verification + corporate records (KYB)

These are extremely useful for “is this a real business and who controls it?” plus liens/bankruptcy and related signals.

Middesk (business verification / KYB API)

Middesk “Verify a business” quickstart and API docs show workflow-style verification.

Their API schema includes fields for things like liens, litigations, watchlist screening, and even FMCSA registrations (based on the API response schema).

OpenCorporates (corporate entity data)

OpenCorporates offers a REST API for corporate entity information.

D&B Direct+ (business data & enrichment)

D&B Direct+ provides APIs and its own documentation portal.

Experian (business information / onboarding data)

Experian positions its business data APIs for credit/compliance onboarding via an API hub/developer portal.

Trulioo Business Verification

Trulioo includes Business Verification guides and broader KYB/KYC capabilities.

Why KYB tools matter for moving carriers

Many “bad actors” are serial rebrands. KYB tools help you connect: legal entity ⇄ addresses ⇄ principals ⇄ related entities.

8) Litigation, court documents, and legal analytics APIs

If you want to programmatically find lawsuits/judgments relevant to fraud, claims, negligence, etc.:

CourtListener (Free Law Project) + RECAP

CourtListener provides a REST API that covers case law and PACER/RECAP data.

RECAP APIs are specifically for PACER-originated documents in the RECAP Archive.

UniCourt Enterprise API

UniCourt provides an Enterprise API (with SDKs) intended for structured court data access.

Agent workflow tip

Litigation search is high-noise: require the agent to (a) match identity precisely (address/DBA/principal), (b) classify case type, (c) extract dispositions/judgments when available, and (d) store the docket links as evidence.

9) Background checks + principal screening APIs (since you already do this)
Background screening platforms (API-first-ish)

Checkr (background check API docs; plus “Checkr Trust” API for certain trust/screening use cases).

HireRight Connect API (ordering/tracking background screens; RESTful integration).

Sterling API (background checks integrated end-to-end; recurring screenings mentioned in API docs).

Watchlist / sanctions / PEP screening

ComplyAdvantage API (REST API for screening/monitoring workflows).

OpenSanctions API (query the OpenSanctions entity graph; match/search entities).

Important design note:
Even if you’re allowed to run these checks, have the agent output a risk finding + evidence references, not raw sensitive personal data, unless you truly need it. Make “minimal retention” a first-class design goal.

10) News / adverse media / complaint monitoring APIs

These help detect “the carrier just got exposed / sued / raided / had a TV investigation.”

NewsAPI: HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving articles.

GDELT Doc API: global news/event database with a full-text search API.

(Optional) Event Registry / NewsAPI.ai (another news intelligence API ecosystem).

Agent usage pattern

Run daily/weekly searches on:

carrier legal name, DBA, phone, address

principal names

“hostage load” / “moving scam” terms near the brand

Alert only on high-confidence matches.
